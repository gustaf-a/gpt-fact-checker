Multiple studies have shown a strong association between high levels of LDL cholesterol and an increased risk of heart disease. Elevated LDL cholesterol contributes to the development of atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of plaque in the arteries, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. Lowering LDL cholesterol levels through lifestyle changes (such as a healthy diet and exercise) or medication has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. References: [1] [2] [3]\"\n}"

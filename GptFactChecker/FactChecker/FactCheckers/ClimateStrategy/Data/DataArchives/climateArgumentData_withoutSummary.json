        "CounterArgumentText": "Similar summer Arctic storms to the one which occurred in 2012 had very little impact on the eventual annual sea ice minimum. The 2012 Arctic storm only had a significant impact on the annual minimum because of the long-term, primarily human-caused deterioration of Arctic sea ice."

        "CounterArgumentText": "There are several ways in which human-caused global warming contributed to the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy - by causing higher sea levels (bigger storm surges and flooding), warmer oceans (a stronger hurricane), and more moisture in the air (more flooding)."

        "CounterArgumentText": "Lord Monckton has taken a single equation from the IPCC, used it in an inappropriate manner, and then attributed his results to the IPCC. This is as if I borrowed your car, drove into a tree, and then blamed you. He uses a method that is clearly intended to examine the long-term response of temperature to changes in carbon dioxide, and which is never used by the IPCC (nor should it be) to make predictions about current temperature trends. A slight change in Lord Monckton\u2019s methodology as of July 2010 still does not make his method or attribution remotely appropriate."

        "CounterArgumentText": "Once natural influences, in particular the impact of El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a, are removed from the recent termperature record, there is no evidence of a significant change in the human contribution to climate change."

        "Id": 494613,
        "CounterArgumentText": "Recent studies concluding that climate sensitivity is unlikely to be very high (above 4\u00b0C global surface warming in response to doubled atmospheric CO2) are often fundamentally flawed because they ignore the accelerated warming of the deep oceans. However, these studies still agree that climate sensitivity is within the IPCC expected range."

        "Id": 196893,
        "CounterArgumentText": "The 97% consensus on human-caused global warming is a result of two independent survey methods (volunteer abstract ratings and scientist self-ratings of full papers), and consistent with similar previous surveys. No significant accurate criticisms of the study have yet been advanced."

        "Id": 414041,
        "CounterArgumentText": "Peer-reviewed research, physics, and math all tell us that a grand solar minimum would have no more than a 0.3\u00b0C cooling effect, barely enough to put a dent in human-caused global warming."

        "CounterArgumentText": "Akasofu's argument is based on magical thinking and curve fitting without any physical explanation. Climate changes must have a physical cause, for example the increased greenhouse effect."

        "Id": 481226,
        "CounterArgumentText": "The IPCC report shows that when we account for the warming of the entire climate system, global warming continues at a rapid rate, equivalent to 4 Hiroshima atomic bomb detonations per second."

        "Id": 822715,
        "CounterArgumentText": "If anyone claims to be part of the 97%, it means they disagree with the contrarian argument that humans are having a minimal impact on global warming. Moreover, in order to be part of the 96% expert consensus, they must explicitly agree that humans are responsible for the majority of the global warming over the past half-century."

        "Id": 194899,
        "CounterArgumentText": "The data and research aren't conclusive as to whether climate change is increasing extreme weather damage costs. However, many types of extreme weather are becoming more intense and/or frequent, and disaster costs from extreme weather events are rising."

        "CounterArgumentText": "The burning of fossil fuels for electricity and heat accounts for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions, totaling 31% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions, followed by transportation at 15%, manufacturing at 12.4% and animal agriculture at 11% (World Resources Institute)."

        "CounterArgumentText": "Holistic Management is not a solution to the problem of increasing carbon emissions and climate change. Soils managed holistically show no significant boost in productivity or overall storage of carbon over a long period of time. Holistic Management offers no advantage over other similar grazing techniques in use today."

    {
        "Id": 157650,
        "CounterArgumentText": "Global warming worsens wildfires by drying vegetation and soil, creating more fuel for fires to spread further and faster. In some areas like southeastern Australia and California, altered atmospheric patterns may also be creating stronger and/or more frequent high pressure systems, resulting in less precipitation and thus both dryer conditions and longer fire seasons."

        "Id": 156229,
        "CounterArgumentText": "Research has shown that maximum afforestation and reforestation (close to a trillion new trees) would sequester around 75 billion tons of carbon, which is 7\u20138 years of annual human emissions at current rates and enough to slow global warming by less than a quarter degree Celsius."
